Here are a few very simple scripts that can be used to make audible
noises in command sequences. This can be useful where the commands can
take a long time to execute, so you leave them running in one terminal
window while you do something else in another window: the beep will
notify you when the sequence has finished. I provide two versions,
with different sounds, that you can use as indications of success or
failure. For example:

    <long-winded command sequence> ...; beep

for a simple beep-at-end-of-sequence, or

    <command> && beep || beep-error

which will invoke “beep” if the <command> exits with a zero (success)
status, or “beep-error” if its exit status is nonzero.

The actual sounds come from KDE, and I play them using paplay.
